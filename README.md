This Python program encrypts and decrypts messages using a basic encryption technique called the Caesar Cipher. The Caesar Cipher shifts each letter of the message by a certain number (called "shift value"). This means each letter is replaced by another letter thatâ€™s a few places ahead or behind in the alphabet.
