# 🔐 Caesar Cipher Encryption/Decryption

This Python program allows you to **encrypt** and **decrypt** messages using the **Caesar Cipher** technique, a basic encryption method where each letter in the message is **shifted** by a certain number of positions in the alphabet.

## ✨ Features

✅ **Encrypt** messages by shifting letters  
✅ **Decrypt** messages to retrieve the original text  
✅ Adjustable **shift value** for customization  
✅ Handles both **uppercase** and **lowercase** letters

## 🔐 How It Works

1. **Encryption**: Each letter of the message is shifted forward by the **shift value** (e.g., shift by 3).
   - Example: `"A"` with a shift value of 3 becomes `"D"`.
   
2. **Decryption**: The message is shifted **backward** by the same **shift value** to reveal the original text.
   - Example: `"D"` with a shift value of 3 becomes `"A"`.

3. The program supports both **uppercase** and **lowercase** letters, while leaving non-alphabetic characters (like spaces and punctuation) unchanged.
